Azure Sentinel is a **SIEM** (security information event management) and **SOAR** (security orchestration automated response) system in Azure. This means that incidents and security threats can be detected and alerted. You can use it to investigate and mitigate threats. You can gain insight into collected data, events and potential harmful incidents through overviews, dashboards and custom queries. Once an accident occurs, you can choose to launch the Azure Sentinel Playbook, a logical application that begins the automatic mitigation process.



## Azure Sentinel four crucial areas or stages:

- **Collect.** Collecting data from multiple sources and clouds, on-premises, applications, infrastructure, users, services, and others.
- **Detect.** Detect threats to protected and monitored resources as they happen, minimizing the time to react to threats.
- **Investigate.** Powered with artificial intelligence, search for and discover malicious activities across all protected assets.
- **Respond.** Once a threat is known, avoid manual actions and respond to threats with automating tasks.
